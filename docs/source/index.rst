Welcome to the SP's documentation!
===================================

The SP is a portable MicroPython-based reprogrammable game console.
It uses an 0.96" OLED display, 7 buttons, an LED, and a speaker.

To learn more about the console itself, read :doc:`hardware`. To
develop software for the console, head over to :doc:`installation`. 
For more information on the programming environment, look at 
:doc:`sdk`. And to learn more about the console APIs themselves, look 
at :doc:`api`.

.. warning::

   This project is incomplete! The SDK is not solidified and the hardware
   APIs are not production ready! If you're interested in becoming a 
   game developer for this console, contact us at rsc.games.official@gmail.com.
